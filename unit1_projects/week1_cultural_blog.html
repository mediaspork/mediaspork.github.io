        <br></br>
        After listening to Shereef's fireside chat, he reaffirmed that Dev Bootcamp is not only going to give me the skills to become a web developer, but also the knowledge to grow personally. The skills that I am going to learn at Dev Bootcamp are much more then just the programing knowledge. I have been interested for the past year in CBT (cognative behavioral theropy) and am glad that I get to explore this in parallel with learning how to program.
        <br></br>
        I was slightly worried prior to listening to the video that I was not going to have enough skills or slow the cohort down because this is my first time programming. I am glad to know that everyone has similar skill levels and I am looking forward to proving myself wrong.
        <br></br>
        Lastly, I am looking forward to developing a community. As more of an introverted person I tend to shy away from social challenges and forcing myself to work with others in peer pairings and guided pairing sessions will help eliminate some of my introverted attitdue. I am excited to see what amazing things can help when a group of incredibly talented people can come together and learn how to program!
