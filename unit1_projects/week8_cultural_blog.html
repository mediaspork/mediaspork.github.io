        Are you having a frustrating day at work? Is it your coworkers or just your job in general? Well, stress and conflicts can come from many different places. According to Art bell and Brett Hart, there are 8 common causes of conflict in the workplace.
        <br></br>
        <b>The eight common cuases of conflict are:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>Conflicting resources</li>
          <li>Conflicting styles</li>
          <li>Conflicting perceptions</li>
          <li>Conflicting goals</li>
          <li>Conflicting pressures</li>
          <li>Conflicting roles</li>
          <li>Different personal values</li>
          <li>Unpredictable policies</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        So these eight different types of conflict exist, but how do they help you?
        <br></br>
        The good news is that resolving conflict successfully, you can solve many of the problems that it has brought to the surface, as well as getting benefits that you might not at first expect. Some of these benefits include: increased understanding, increased group cohesion and increased self-knowledge. Likewise, if the conflict is not handled appropriately then it can have a negative effect.
        <br></br>
        So what are some ways to prevent conflicts?
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li>Make sure that good relationships are the first priority</li>
          <li>Keep people and problems separate</li>
          <li>Pay attention to the interests that are being presented</li>
          <li>Set out the "facts"</li>
          <li>Listen first; talk second</li>
          <li>Explore options together</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        Through my personal experience, I have found that listening first and and talking second has helped significantly. I find that many times the conflict is something that is really minor but gets blown up due to emotions. If you can remove your emotions and think rationally the conflict is not so bad after all! If the other person is not able to do this or don't know that they are being persuaded by their emotions, you can listen to their concerns and then apporach them mutually. Let's make this world conflict free!
