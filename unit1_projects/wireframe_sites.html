        Facebook is trying to make it easier for people to connect no matter where they are. The visual challenge with Facebook is that the user needs to keep scrolling downwards as their is too much content to be seen on the screen at once. Facebook achieves this pretty well however their is a fair amount of unused screen real estate. We also have to keep in mind that they need to also fit in advertising and additional features like messaging and events. All in all, it is very simple which makes it easy to use and asthetically desirable.

       Ever had a song that you wanted to listen to, but didn't want to purchase it? Well, that is where Spotify comes in. Instead of acting like YouTube (which has clear user interface problems for music playing and discovery), Spotify acts more like iTunes and gives users access to millions of songs at the click of a button. There are three elements that must be displayed in their user interface: social, music controls, discovery. Spotify does a good job sticking with what iTunes pioneered which makes it easier for new users to understand. Adding the social element takes up screen real estate, but provides good functionality. Lastly the discovery bar on the left hand side is necessary in finding and playing any song.

        YouTube is the place to go to find videos ranging in quality from cats to professional style movies. YouTube is all about keeping the browser entertained. They do this through suggesting other videos for them to watch on the right hand side and having a comment field below the video. YouTube has not changed significantly over the years which (at least to me) makes it not entirely desirable from a visual perspective. I think they need to take a page from Vimeo and not emphisize the comments as much as the content. At the end of the day, users come for the content first and the comments come second.
