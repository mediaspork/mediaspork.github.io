        Internet security has become a buzzword recently thanks to the news and the NSA. Internet security is a subset of computer security that specifically applies to the internet. There are two types of internet security: browswer and network security. The idea of security is to establish rules to prevent attacks over the internet. As many people don't realize, the internet is a relatively insecure channel for exchanging information which could lead to intrusion, fraud or phishing. The most commonly used method to protect the transfer of data is encryption.
        <br></br>
        There are quite a few different types of security. Here are some of them:
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li>Network layer security</li>
          <p>This is a broad type of security that handles TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol), SSL (Secure Sockets Layer), TLS (Transport layer security and PGP (Pretty Good Privacy).</p>
          <li>Internet protocal security</li>
          <p>This type of security is meant to protect communications and was established by the IEFT. This provides security and authentication on the IP layer by transforming data using encrpytion. There are two main types of transformation: ESP and IPsec.</p>
          <li>Security token</li>
          <p>These are normally physical objects that the user must have to enter a six digit code into the site. The six digit code is calculated by the divice based on the internal time and is only set for 30-60 seconds.</p>
          <li>Electronic mail security</li>
          <p>The emails that we read and write daily go through this layer of security which has many different layers and routes. </p>
          <li>Pretty good privacy</li>
          <p>This form of security provides confidentiality by encrypting messages to be transmitted or data files to be sored using an encryption algorithm such as triple DES or CAST-128.</p>
          <li>Multipurpose internet mail extensions</li>
          <p>This security level transforms data between protocols, typically for email.</p>
          <li>Message authentication code</li>
          <p>This type of security uses a special and secret key to encrpyt a message. The message can be decrypted by the receiver using the same key used by the sender. This protects the data integrity and the authenticity of the message.</p>
        </ul>
