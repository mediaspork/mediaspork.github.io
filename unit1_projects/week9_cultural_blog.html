        As a developer it is extremely important to know how to work with your peers and colleagues. During my short period of time as a developer, I have spent a great deal of time both asking and answering questions.  Through this experience I know how valuable it is to know how to ask and respond to well thought out questions.
        <br></br>
        When trying to answer what is a good question I think that there are two different viewpoints from which we need to view the question: internally and externally.
        <br></br>
        During the next nine weeks ahead of me at Dev Bootcamp, I am sure that I will experience many distressing situations. In order to stay mentally healthy, it is beneficial to manage your stress. So what do those thoughts say about me, or mean to me? I have found that it is helpful to ask the following questions:
        <br></br>
        <ul>
          <li>Is this thought a fact, or just a thought?</li>
          <li>What am I reacting to? What am I giving this situation?</li>
          <li>Is there another way of looking at it?</li>
          <li>What would someone else make of it? It’s often helpful to think about a particular person who you respect, and imagine what they would think about that thought, what meaning they would give it, and how they would react to it.</li>
          <li>What advice would I give someone else (with this thought in this situation)?</li>
          <li>Is my reaction in proportion to the actual event?</li>
          <li>How important is this really? How important will it be in a year’s time?</li>
          <li>What evidence is there that this thought is true?</li>
          <li>What evidence is there that this thought isn’t true (partly or totally)?</li>
          <li>What would be a more balanced way of looking at it?</li>
          <li>What is the bigger picture?</li>
        </ul>
        <br></br>
        Keeping these thoughts and questions in my mind while both answering questions and dealing with stress will prove to be very useful over the coming weeks.
        <br></br>
        Dealing with questions internally is important, but we still need to know what makes a good question. There are a few things that we can keep in mind when formulating and answering questions:
        <br></br>
        Avoid questions that require a single, direct answer. This will be useful at times, but questions like these will discourage many pupils from responding, because they will be thinking: “There is one right answer to this and I don’t want to be seen to get it wrong.”
        <br></br>
        Use questions that invite pupils to talk about what they think. This can help to gather information in a broad way without putting too much pressure on the person answering the question.
        <br></br>
        Give people time to think. Ask a question and then wait. This will allow people time to analyze the question and consider their answer.
        <br></br>
        Encourage people to write things down or think out loud.  This will help to eliminate stress in their short-term memory and allows you to understand their train of thought.
        <br></br>
        Keeping all of this in mind, I am ready to start at Dev Bootcamp!
