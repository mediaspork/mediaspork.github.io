        TechCrunch is one of my favorite sites to pass time throughout the day because it keeps me up to date with what is going on in the tech scene. I am not an entirely techincal person, so I enjoy how they blend tech news with businesses news rather than just covering the technical side. On the homepage you are drawn to the main stories which are featured in the mid-upper left hand side of the screen. Techcrunch could use some search improvements as well as better catagories for content discovery rather than requiring the user to just scroll through old posts.

       Engadget is one of my favorite sites for techincal news but unfortunately it has gone downhill since some of their top journalists have left to start The Verge. Up until recently, Engadget did not offer any reviews which seperated them from Cnet and other tech sites. I believe they suffer from a similar problem to Techcrunch as far as content discover goes. They tend to keep the website up to date and have a simple and clean user interface. For that reason it is typically my go to spot for tech news.

        I love oDesk! My businesses (and additional work) would not have succeeded without oDesk. I believe that a specialized global economy is the future and one key element to that is a remote workforce. oDesk connects employeers and freelancers from around the world through their easy to use website. The navigation is clear and simple and their time tracking software provides employeers with clear insight into what their contractors are doing on a 10 minute basis. At the end of the week you don't have to worry about paying or negotiating with your contractors, oDesk simply bills your credit card. How much easier can it get?
