        Both functional programming and object-oriented programming have the power to create applications. Although they can both produce an end result, there are major differences between the two. The largest difference is the relationship between data and operations on the data.

        Object oriented program is a concept that objects that have data fields and are associated with procedures known as methods. Objects are instances of certain classes and are used to interact with one another to design and build applications.

        The goals of object-oriented program are to increase understanding, ease of maintenance and ease of evolution.  Object-oriented programming is more focused on modeling the approach first, which is a logical extension of good design practices. Because object-oriented programing is a logical extension, it lessens the gap between the language spoken by users and developers.  Unlike historic spaghetti code, object-oriented programming combines abstract data types with structured programing and divides systems into modular objects have their own data and are responsible for their own functions.

        Functional Programming is a style of building applications that rely only on the inputs and the outputs and not the variable state of the program. Data is only loosely coupled to functions in functional programming. The centerpiece of functional programming is writing new functions. 

        Now choosing which type of programming language is really up to you. Good software is written in bot styles, because good software has more than one need to satisfy.
