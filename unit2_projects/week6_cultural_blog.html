        I am surrounded by stereotypes. Some I might not even realize, some I unknowingly accept and others I defend. It is difficult to make the world an environment that is nonbiased and supportive to everyone.

        As mentioned in the Colombia lecture, we are confronted with stereotype threats multiple times a day. No, this is certainly not ideal but this is the world that we live in. So knowing that we have this, how do we shape our social identity?

        What is social identity? Well, I am glad you asked. Social identity could be anything that shapes the sense of who we are. They typically come from social categories to which we belong:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Age</li>
        <li>Sex</li>
        <li>Race</li>
        <li>Religion</li>
        <li>Profession</li>
        <li>Ethnicity</li>
        <li>Nationality</li>
        <li>Sexual Orientation</li>
        <li>Social Class</li>
        <li>Ideological Persuasion</li>
        <li>Political Affiliation</li>
        <li>Mental Health Status</li>
        <li>Etc.</li>
      </ul>

       My social identity is largely shaped by my age. Since I am only 18, I undergo different stereotypes then many adults. At the age of 14 I started working and even launched my first business doing systems consulting. Many people thought that I was crazy and maybe even going through some social anxiety. They would ask me why I wasn’t playing outside like everyone else.

      At the age 16 things really started to heat up because I launched my own ice cream line that made its way to Whole Foods. People believed that my parents were the real business owners and I was just used for publicity. People didn’t understand me. They didn’t understand that working was what I was passionate about and loved to do.

      People have a stereotype in their head that kids are immature and would rather have fun then work. I understand and accept why this stereotype exists, but wouldn’t it be better not to judge a book by its cover.

      My most recent ventures was manufacturing and shipping disposable products in China and the United States. Luckily most of my work was done through email or over the phone so people couldn’t tell my age. But at the end of the day age is just a number and I am proud of what I have done. 

      Because of my experiences I am more accepting of others and willing to give people an opportunity to succeed. I will work to make my work environment more inviting to everyone by providing them an opportunity. People can choose to work with us or not, but it is their true immaturity that begins to show if they can’t get over a number.
